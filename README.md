# Dicee Website

Welcome to the Dicee website repository! This is a simple web-based dice game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game simulates rolling two dice and displays the results on the webpage.

## Preview

Here's a brief overview of the sections included in the Move It app:

The Dicee website allows users to roll two dice with the click of a button. Each dice roll generates random numbers between 1 and 6, simulating the outcome of rolling physical dice.
